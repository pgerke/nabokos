    "licenseText": "# Nabokos\r\n\r\nA clone of the Sokoban puzzle game for the browser created using Angular 10.\r\n\r\n## Goal of the Game ##\r\n\r\nThe goal of the game is to push all boxes <img src=\"src/assets/svg/box.svg\" alt=\"box image\" width=\"16px\"> into target areas <img src=\"src/assets/png/target.png\" alt=\"target image\" width=\"16px\"> as fast as possible (making them <img src=\"src/assets/svg/box_in_target.svg\" alt=\"box in target image\" width=\"16px\">) using the least number of moves. Towards that purpose, the player <img src=\"src/assets/svg/player.svg\" alt=\"player image\" width=\"16px\"> can move left, right, up and down. You cannot move diagonally or jump or fly. Any you never will, no point in asking!\r\n\r\nBoxes can only be pushed, not pulled, so take care not push them into a corner! Also, boxes are heavy, so you can only push one box at a time, no stacking!\r\n\r\nLuckily, you can undo moves, if you think you made a mistake. But beware, undoing a move will also be counted as a move. Of course, you can always start from the beginning, if you think you really screwed up. If you do that, the level timer and move counter will be reset.\r\n\r\nIf you beat a puzzle, the level time and the number of moves it took you will be recorded in the highscore. In accordance with our [privacy policy](https://github.com/pgerke/nabokos/blob/master/README.md#privacy-policy) the highscore is stored in the local storage of your browser and not accessible to anyone but yourself. However, you can make screenshots, if you need to brag.\r\n\r\n## Controls ##\r\n\r\nYou can play Nabokos using a mouse, a keyboard or a touch device. While using a touch device or mouse, click or tap on the field you would like to move to, to have the player go there. Click or tap on a box while standing next to it to push it. Clicks or taps on wall tiles <img src=\"src/assets/svg/wall.svg\" alt=\"wall image\" width=\"16px\"> or the floor outside the accessible puzzle area, will be ignored.\r\n\r\n### Keyboard Bindings ###\r\n\r\nIf you want to play Nabokos with a keyboard, you can use the following controls to solve the puzzles:\r\n\r\n* <kbd>W</kbd>, <kbd>w</kbd> or <kbd>&#8593;</kbd> to move the player up\r\n* <kbd>A</kbd>, <kbd>a</kbd> or <kbd>&#8592;</kbd> to move the player left\r\n* <kbd>S</kbd>, <kbd>s</kbd> or <kbd>&#8595;</kbd> to move the player down\r\n* <kbd>D</kbd>, <kbd>d</kbd> or <kbd>&#8594;</kbd> to move the player right\r\n* <kbd>Z</kbd>, <kbd>z</kbd> or <kbd>Backspace</kbd> to undo the last move\r\n* <kbd>I</kbd>, <kbd>i</kbd> or <kbd>+</kbd> to zoom in\r\n* <kbd>O</kbd>, <kbd>o</kbd> or <kbd>-</kbd> to zoom out\r\n\r\nMoving in the direction of a box while standing next to it, will push the box, if possible.\r\n\r\n### Zooming ###\r\n\r\nWhile playing on a small device, you can easily get lost with all the boxes and walls, but don't worry, there is something you can do. For zooming outside you need two fingers touching the screen where the level is located, moving towards one another. Now you can see the bigger picture right? But, oh no, now the level is to tiny to click on a specific field! Keep calm, you can of course also zoom inside the level. It is hardly the same as zooming outside, again you need to fingers touching the screen, but now moving away from one another. Awesome right? For non touch devices you can use the keyboard bindings as shown above.\r\n\r\n## Savegames ##\r\n\r\nWe are aware that some puzzles are ~frustrating~ challenging. So in order to prevent you from banging your head into the keyboard, we are giving you the option to save the progress for your current puzzle. Just click the <img src=\"src/assets/svg/save.svg\" alt=\"wall image\" width=\"16px\"> button in the footer to create a savegame and the <img src=\"src/assets/svg/load.svg\" alt=\"wall image\" width=\"16px\"> button to restore it again. Move counter and level timer will be reset to the values at the time the savegame was created. But beware: Clicking the save button again will overwrite your previous savegame! Also, you only have one savegame slot. So saving progress on another puzzle, will also overwrite your current savegame.\r\n\r\n## System Requirements ##\r\n\r\n* A modern browser supporting JavaScript. No, Internet Explorer, I'm not even looking at you! Shoo!\r\n* An active connection to the internet (at least initially)</sub>\r\n* Some kind of input device supporting one of the aforementioned control methods\r\n\r\nNabokos is implemented as a progressive web application ([PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_applications)) the uses service workers on supported browsers to enable users to run the application without an active connection or even as a native app after it was loaded initially. This feature is not supported by every browser or operating system.\r\n\r\n## Privacy Policy ##\r\n\r\nNabokos does not use cookies or collect personal data of any kind. Period.\r\n\r\n## Reporting Issues ##\r\n\r\nWe are happy to hear any feedback regarding the game or it's implementation, be it critizism, praise or rants about the insane difficulty level of some puzzles (yeah, we feel you...). Please create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/pgerke/nabokos/issues) if you would like to contact us. \r\n\r\nWe would especially appreciate, if you could report any issues you encounter while playing Nabokos, because, issues we know we probably can fix.\r\n\r\nIf you want to submit a bug report, please check if the issue you have has already been reported. If you want to contribute additional information to the issue, please add it to the existing issue instead of creating another one. Duplicate issues will take time from bugfixing and thus delay a fix.\r\n\r\nWhile creating a bug report, please make it easy for us to fix it by giving us all the details you have about the issue. Always include the version of the game and a short concise description of the issue. Besides that, we are especially interested in learning about a few other topics.\r\n\r\n### Environment ###\r\n\r\nOn which device, operating system and/or browser did you observe the issue. Feel free to include any version number you know! Example:\r\n\r\n>Device: iPad Pro 11' (2018) <br>\r\n>OS: iPadOS 13.2.1 <br>\r\n>Browser: Safari\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce ###\r\n\r\nWhat did you have to do in order to make the issue appear. Example:\r\n\r\n> 1. Click on the *Open* button\r\n> 1. Enter the data in the form\r\n> 1. Click on *Submit*\r\n\r\n### Expected result ###\r\n\r\nExplain in a short, concise way, what you would have expected to happen. Example:\r\n\r\n> Form should submit\r\n\r\n### Actual result ###\r\n\r\nExplain in a short, concise way, what happened. Example: \r\n\r\n> Loading indicator shows and the form is not submitted\r\n\r\n### Additional Information ###\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to submit any additional information that you deem useful for us in identifying and fixing the issue, like screenshots or screencasts, data on how often the bug replicates (every time, two out of three times, ..., every second Sunday). \r\n\r\n## Feature Requests ##\r\n\r\nWith the exception of flying or jumping, we also accept feature requests - even though we cannot guarantee if or when we will implement them...\r\n\r\n## Last but not least\r\n\r\nThanks you very much for playing Nabokos! We hope you enjoy it!"

HERE BEGINS THE INTERESTING STUFF 🚨 -->\n\n## Wut? Poppers?\n\nA popper is an element on the screen which \"pops out\" from the natural flow of your application.  \nCommon examples of poppers are tooltips, popovers and drop-downs.\n\n\n## So, yet another tooltip library?\n\nWell, basically, **no**.  \nPopper.js is a **positioning engine**, its purpose is to calculate the position of an element\nto make it possible to position it near a given reference element.  \n\nThe engine is completely modular and most of its features are implemented as **modifiers**\n(similar to middlewares or plugins).  \nThe whole code base is written in ES2015 and its features are automatically tested on real browsers thanks to [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/) and [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/).\n\nPopper.js has zero dependencies. No jQuery, no LoDash, nothing.  \nIt's used by big companies like [Twitter in Bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Microsoft in WebClipper](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/WebClipper) and [Atlassian in AtlasKit](https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/atlaskit/registry/).\n\n### Popper.js\n\nThis is the engine, the library that computes and, optionally, applies the styles to\nthe poppers.\n\nSome of the key points are:\n\n- Position elements keeping them in their original DOM context (doesn't mess with your DOM!);\n- Allows to export the computed informations to integrate with React and other view libraries;\n- Supports Shadow DOM elements;\n- Completely customizable thanks to the modifiers based structure;\n\nVisit our [project page](https://fezvrasta.github.io/popper.js) to see a lot of examples of what you can do with Popper.js!\n\nFind [the documentation here](/docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md).\n\n\n### Tooltip.js\n\nSince lots of users just need a simple way to integrate powerful tooltips in their projects,\nwe created **Tooltip.js**.  \nIt's a small library that makes it easy to automatically create tooltips using as engine Popper.js.  \nIts API is almost identical to the famous tooltip system of Bootstrap, in this way it will be\neasy to integrate it in your projects.  \nThe tooltips generated by Tooltip.js are accessible thanks to the `aria` tags.\n\nFind [the documentation here](/docs/_includes/tooltip-documentation.md).\n\n\n## Installation\nPopper.js is available on the following package managers and CDNs:\n\n| Source |                                                                                  |\n|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| npm    | `npm install popper.js --save`                                                   |\n| yarn   | `yarn add popper.js`                                                             |\n| NuGet  | `PM> Install-Package popper.js`                                                  |\n| Bower  | `bower install popper.js --save`                     |\n| unpkg  | [`https://unpkg.com/popper.js`](https://unpkg.com/popper.js)                     |\n| cdnjs  | [`https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js`](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js) |\n\nTooltip.js as well:\n\n| Source |                                                                                  |\n|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| npm    | `npm install tooltip.js --save`                                                  |\n| yarn   | `yarn add tooltip.js`                                                            |\n| Bower* | `bower install tooltip.js=https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js --save`                   |\n| unpkg  | [`https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js`](https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js)                   |\n| cdnjs  | [`https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js`](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js) |\n\n\\*: Bower isn't officially supported, it can be used to install Tooltip.js only trough the unpkg.com CDN. This method has the limitation of not being able to define a specific version of the library. Bower and Popper.js suggests to use npm or Yarn for your projects.  \nFor more info, [read the related issue](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/390).\n\n### Dist targets\n\nPopper.js is currently shipped with 3 targets in mind: UMD, ESM and ESNext.\n\n- UMD - Universal Module Definition: AMD, RequireJS and globals;\n- ESM - ES Modules: For webpack/Rollup or browser supporting the spec;\n- ESNext: Available in `dist/`, can be used with webpack and `babel-preset-env`;\n\nMake sure to use the right one for your needs. If you want to import it with a `<script>` tag, use UMD.\n\n## Usage\n\nGiven an existing popper DOM node, ask Popper.js to position it near its button\n\n```js\nvar reference = document.querySelector('.my-button');\nvar popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper');\nvar anotherPopper = new Popper(\n    reference,\n    popper,\n    {\n        // popper options here\n    }\n);\n```\n\n### Callbacks\n\nPopper.js supports two kinds of callbacks, the `onCreate` callback is called after\nthe popper has been initialized. The `onUpdate` one is called on any subsequent update.\n\n```js\nconst reference = document.querySelector('.my-button');\nconst popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper');\nnew Popper(reference, popper, {\n    onCreate: (data) => {\n        // data is an object containing all the informations computed\n        // by Popper.js and used to style the popper and its arrow\n        // The complete description is available in Popper.js documentation\n    },\n    onUpdate: (data) => {\n        // same as `onCreate` but called on subsequent updates\n    }\n});\n```\n\n### Writing your own modifiers\n\nPopper.js is based on a \"plugin-like\" architecture, most of its features are fully encapsulated \"modifiers\".  \nA modifier is a function that is called each time Popper.js needs to compute the position of the popper. For this reason, modifiers should be very performant to avoid bottlenecks.  \n\nTo learn how to create a modifier, [read the modifiers documentation](docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md#modifiers--object)\n\n\n### React, Vue.js, Angular, AngularJS, Ember.js (etc...) integration\n\nIntegrating 3rd party libraries in React or other libraries can be a pain because\nthey usually alter the DOM and drive the libraries crazy.  \nPopper.js limits all its DOM modifications inside the `applyStyle` modifier,\nyou can simply disable it and manually apply the popper coordinates using\nyour library of choice.  \n\nFor a comprehensive list of libraries that let you use Popper.js into existing\nframeworks, visit the [MENTIONS](/MENTIONS.md) page.\n\nAlternatively, you may even override your own `applyStyles` with your custom one and\nintegrate Popper.js by yourself!\n\n```js\nfunction applyReactStyle(data) {\n    // export data in your framework and use its content to apply the style to your popper\n};\n\nconst reference = document.querySelector('.my-button');\nconst popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper');\nnew Popper(reference, popper, {\n    modifiers: {\n        applyStyle: { enabled: false },\n        applyReactStyle: {\n            enabled: true,\n            fn: applyReactStyle,\n            order: 800,\n        },\n    },\n});\n\n```\n\n### Migration from Popper.js v0\n\nSince the API changed, we prepared some migration instructions to make it easy to upgrade to\nPopper.js v1.  \n\nhttps://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/62\n\nFeel free to comment inside the issue if you have any questions.\n\n### Performances\n\nPopper.js is very performant. It usually takes 0.5ms to compute a popper's position (on an iMac with 3.5G GHz Intel Core i5).  \nThis means that it will not cause any [jank](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/trace-event-profiling-tool/anatomy-of-jank), leading to a smooth user experience.\n\n## Notes\n\n### Libraries using Popper.js\n\nThe aim of Popper.js is to provide a stable and powerful positioning engine ready to\nbe used in 3rd party libraries.  \n\nVisit the [MENTIONS](/MENTIONS.md) page for an updated list of projects.\n\n\n### Credits\nI want to thank some friends and projects for the work they did:\n\n- [@AndreaScn](https://github.com/AndreaScn) for his work on the GitHub Page and the manual testing he did during the development;\n- [@vampolo](https://github.com/vampolo) for the original idea and for the name of the library;\n- [Sysdig](https://github.com/Draios) for all the awesome things I learned during these years that made it possible for me to write this library;\n- [Tether.js](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/) for having inspired me in writing a positioning library ready for the real world;\n- [The Contributors](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/graphs/contributors) for their much appreciated Pull Requests and bug reports;\n- **you** for the star you'll give to this project and for being so awesome to give this project a try 🙂\n\n### Copyright and license\nCode and documentation copyright 2016 **Federico Zivolo**.
